# Welcome to the Vikrant Underwater Robot Li-Fi Library!
Wireless communications, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, are commonly used in the daily life. However, rc signal are observed by the water it will not works properly..

The Li-Fi  aims to explore the potential of Li-Fi technology for wireless data transmission using Arduino microcontrollers. This project leverages the power of light waves to enable communication between devices, offering an alternative to traditional wireless protocols such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

# Background
Wireless communication has become an integral part of our daily lives, but it faces limitations when it comes to underwater environments. In such scenarios, Li-Fi emerges as a promising solution by utilizing light waves to transmit data. Unlike traditional radio frequency-based communication, Li-Fi enables data transmission through LED devices with a data wave generator. This allows us to maintain the functionality of LEDs while simultaneously transmitting data in the background.

# How It Works
Li-Fi, communicating using light waves between two devices, a  solution to transmit data underwater. LED devices with a data wave generator may keep the lighting functionality of a LED while sending data in the background. With the full range of the visible and infrared light spectrum, we may transmit data day and night. With Li-Fi, data communication happens indoors with low latency and high speed. It work outdoor with high latency slow speed. On the receiver side, a small clor detecter which usually detect red light  receives as the signal and  gentrate string according to time led glow. It thus saves energy lost in standard wireless data transmission. The system consists of two Arduino (microcontroller) devices as the emitter and receiver. The user interface, based on the c++ programing, is used to control sending and receiving data. I LED signals the beginning and end of the data transmission During the transmission, LEDs switching on and off signal binary 0’s and 1’s

This system can transmit text and number successfully. However, with the limitation of the interference of sunlight. it is hard to reach high speeds in data transmission. With high-end and low-response-time components, it will be not able to transmit live videos at high speeds. The Li-Fi system
